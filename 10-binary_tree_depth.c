 * binary_tree_depth - Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.

 * Return: If tree is NULL, your function must return 0, else return the depth.
 *
 * Description: This function calculates the depth of a node in a binary tree
 *              recursively by counting the number of parents until the root.
